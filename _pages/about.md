<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a senior undergraduate student at Fudan University, School of Journalism, Department of  Communication in Shanghai, China. 

My research explores the relationship between communication technologies and social behaviors within societal and political contexts. I investigate how technological advancements shape political discourse, social media engagement, and online news production. 

I mostly use computational and quantitative methods, but I also have experienced in qualitative method such as in-depth interview.My technical skills include programming languages such as Python and R, as well as proficiency in Stata, SPSS, and visualization tools like Adobe Photoshop.

With a strong foundation in data analysis, visualization, and academic collaboration, I aim to deepen my understanding of the intersection between technology and communication to contribute to the global discourse on media and society. Recently, my work focused on how short-video platforms influence public perception and engagement, as well as the production and consumption of online news.

I like cooking and baking in my spare time. Also, I run and play tennis regularly. I am a fan of classical guitar and are recently learning how to play it.
